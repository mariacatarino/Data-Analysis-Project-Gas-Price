# Data Analysis Project: Creation of a graph showing the change in gas prices between 1990 and 2008 in the countries selected in the dataset.  
---
### The project uses a dataset that relates gas prices over a range of years.  
### The objective of the project is to make a graph that facilitates the visualization of this relationship.  
---
#### The following treatment was done on the dataset:  
1. The values of the columns Australia, Italy, USA and Japan were selected to generate the chart visualization.  
2. The project presents two methods for creating the graph:  
  * In the first method, the colors and the type of marker desired are specified one by one to build the lines of the graph for each country.  
  * In the second method, using a conditional structure, the process can be simplified, but the colors of the lines are random.
3. At the end, a graph was created with the information obtained, which was exported in png.

### **Conclusion:**  
1. The project was useful to be able to create a graph to better visualize the relationships of the data sets.  
2. It can be seen, through the chosen columns, that Italy obtained the highest gas prices over the years and that the United States obtained the lowest values.  
3. Both methods presented in the project are functional.  
4. Creating a chart using such a dataset can serve as a template for similar visualizations in other datasets.
